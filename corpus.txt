A vulnerability in the quality of service (QoS) subsystem of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. The vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checking of certain values in packets that are destined for UDP port 18999 of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected device. When the packets are processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with elevated privileges. The attacker could also leverage this vulnerability to cause the device to reload, causing a temporary DoS condition while the device is reloading. The malicious packets must be destined to and processed by an affected device. Traffic transiting a device will not trigger the vulnerability. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf73881.

Devices with IS-IS configured on the interface are not vulnerable to this issue unless CLNS routing is also enabled. This issue only affects devices running Junos OS 15.1. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1F5-S3, 15.1F6-S8, 15.1F7, 15.1R5; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D60; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D66, 15.1X53-D233, 15.1X53-D471. Earlier releases are unaffected by this vulnerability, and the issue has been resolved in Junos OS 16.1R1 and all subsequent releases.
An incorrect permissions vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on vMX may allow local unprivileged users on a host system read access to vMX or vPFE images and obtain sensitive information contained in them such as private cryptographic keys. This issue was found during internal product security testing. Juniper SIRT is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this vulnerability. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 15.1 prior to 15.1F5; 14.1 prior to 14.1R8
A vulnerability in the logic that handles access control to one of the hardware components in Cisco's proprietary Secure Boot implementation could allow an authenticated, local attacker to write a modified firmware image to the component. This vulnerability affects multiple Cisco products that support hardware-based Secure Boot functionality. The vulnerability is due to an improper check on the area of code that manages on-premise updates to a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) part of the Secure Boot hardware implementation. An attacker with elevated privileges and access to the underlying operating system that is running on the affected device could exploit this vulnerability by writing a modified firmware image to the FPGA. A successful exploit could either cause the device to become unusable (and require a hardware replacement) or allow tampering with the Secure Boot verification process, which under some circumstances may allow the attacker to install and boot a malicious software image. An attacker will need to fulfill all the following conditions to attempt to exploit this vulnerability: Have privileged administrative access to the device. Be able to access the underlying operating system running on the device; this can be achieved either by using a supported, documented mechanism or by exploiting another vulnerability that would provide an attacker with such access. Develop or have access to a platform-specific exploit. An attacker attempting to exploit this vulnerability across multiple affected platforms would need to research each one of those platforms and then develop a platform-specific exploit. Although the research process could be reused across different platforms, an exploit developed for a given hardware platform is unlikely to work on a different hardware platform.
Juniper Junos OS before 12.1X46-D50, 12.1X47 before 12.1X47-D23, 12.3X48 before 12.3X48-D25, and 15.1X49 before 15.1X49-D40 on a High-End SRX-Series chassis system with one or more Application Layer Gateways (ALGs) enabled allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption, fab link failure, or flip-flop failovers) via vectors related to in-transit traffic matching ALG rules.
Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the J-Web interface in Juniper JUNOS 8.5R1.14 allow remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the host parameter to (1) the pinghost program, reachable through the diagnose program; or (2) the traceroute program, reachable through the diagnose program; or (3) the probe-limit parameter to the configuration program; the (4) wizard-ids or (5) pager-new-identifier parameter in a firewall-filters action to the configuration program; (6) the cos-physical-interface-name parameter in a cos-physical-interfaces-edit action to the configuration program; the (7) wizard-args or (8) wizard-ids parameter in an snmp action to the configuration program; the (9) username or (10) fullname parameter in a users action to the configuration program; or the (11) certname or (12) certbody parameter in a local-cert (aka https) action to the configuration program.
Mikrotik RouterOS before 6.44.5 (long-term release tree) is vulnerable to memory exhaustion. By sending a crafted HTTP request, an authenticated remote attacker can crash the HTTP server and in some circumstances reboot the system. Malicious code cannot be injected.
A vulnerability in the FTP daemon on MikroTik routers through 6.44.3 could allow remote attackers to exhaust all available memory, causing the device to reboot because of uncontrolled resource management.
The IKEv2 client and initiator implementations in Cisco IOS 15.5(3)M and IOS XE allow remote IKEv2 servers to cause a denial of service (device reload) via crafted IKEv2 packets, aka Bug ID CSCux97540.
Cisco IOS 12.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by establishing many IPv6 neighbors, aka Bug ID CSCtn78957.
A vulnerability in Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute commands on the underlying Linux shell of an affected device with root privileges. The vulnerability occurs because the affected software improperly sanitizes user-supplied input. An attacker who has valid administrator access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a username with a malicious payload in the web UI and subsequently making a request to a specific endpoint in the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands as the root user, allowing complete compromise of the system.

A sustained sequence of different types of normal transit traffic can trigger a high CPU consumption denial of service condition in the Junos OS register and schedule software interrupt handler subsystem when a specific command is issued to the device. This affects one or more threads and conversely one or more running processes running on the system. Once this occurs, the high CPU event(s) affects either or both the forwarding and control plane. As a result of this condition the device can become inaccessible in either or both the control and forwarding plane and stops forwarding traffic until the device is rebooted. The issue will reoccur after reboot upon receiving further transit traffic. Score: 5.7 MEDIUM (CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) For network designs utilizing layer 3 forwarding agents or other ARP through layer 3 technologies, the score is slightly higher. Score: 6.5 MEDIUM (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) If the following entry exists in the RE message logs then this may indicate the issue is present.

NOTE: the provenance of this issue is unknown; the details are obtained solely from the BID.
The IKE implementation in Cisco IOS 12.2 through 12.4 on Cisco 7200 and 7301 routers with VAM2+ allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device reload) via a malformed IKE packet, aka Bug ID CSCtb13491. Per:http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_advisory09186a0080b20ee5.shtml

'IPsec is an IP security feature that provides robust authentication and encryption of IP packets. IKE is a key management protocol standard that is used with the IPsec standard.

IKE is a hybrid protocol that implements the Oakley and SKEME key exchanges inside the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) framework. (ISAKMP, Oakley, and SKEME are security protocols that are implemented by IKE.). More information on IKE is available at the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/sec_secure_connectivity/configuration/guide/sec_key_exch_ipsec.html

A vulnerability exists in the Cisco IOS Software implementation of IKE where a malformed packet may cause a device running Cisco IOS Software to reload. Only Cisco 7200 Series and Cisco 7301 routers running Cisco IOS software with a VPN Acceleration Module 2+ (VAM2+) installed are affected.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCtb13491 ( registered customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2010-0578.'
Integer overflow in Cisco IOS allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: as of 20071016, the only disclosure is a vague pre-advisory with no actionable information. However, since it is from a well-known researcher, it is being assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes.
The TFTP server in Cisco IOS 12.2(44)SQ1, 12.2(33)XN1, 12.4(25e)JAM1, 12.4(25e)JAO5m, 12.4(23)JY, 15.0(2)ED1, 15.0(2)EY3, 15.1(3)SVF4a, and 15.2(2)JB1 and IOS XE 2.5.x, 2.6.x, 3.1.xS, 3.2.xS, 3.3.xS, 3.4.xS, and 3.5.xS before 3.6.0S; 3.1.xSG, 3.2.xSG, and 3.3.xSG before 3.4.0SG; 3.2.xSE before 3.3.0SE; 3.2.xXO before 3.3.0XO; 3.2.xSQ; 3.3.xSQ; and 3.4.xSQ allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device hang or reload) via multiple requests that trigger improper memory management, aka Bug ID CSCts66733.
A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) module of Cisco IOS 15.0 through 15.6 and Cisco IOS XE 3.5 through 16.5 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high CPU utilization, traceback messages, or a reload of an affected device that leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to how an affected device processes certain IKEv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IKEv2 packets to an affected device to be processed. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause high CPU utilization, traceback messages, or a reload of the affected device that leads to a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that have the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) enabled. Although only IKEv2 packets can be used to trigger this vulnerability, devices that are running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software are vulnerable when ISAKMP is enabled. A device does not need to be configured with any IKEv2-specific features to be vulnerable. Many features use IKEv2, including different types of VPNs such as the following: LAN-to-LAN VPN; Remote-access VPN, excluding SSL VPN; Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN); and FlexVPN. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc41277.
The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS 12.0 through 12.4 and 15.0 through 15.6 and IOS XE 2.2 through 3.17 contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to remotely execute code on an affected system or cause an affected system to reload. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected system via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to an affected system can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are due to a buffer overflow condition in the SNMP subsystem of the affected software. The vulnerabilities affect all versions of SNMP: Versions 1, 2c, and 3. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system. All devices that have enabled SNMP and have not explicitly excluded the affected MIBs or OIDs should be considered vulnerable. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve60402.
A vulnerability in the implementation of RSA-encrypted nonces in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to obtain the encrypted nonces of an Internet Key Exchange Version 1 (IKEv1) session. The vulnerability exists because the affected software responds incorrectly to decryption failures. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability sending crafted ciphertexts to a device configured with IKEv1 that uses RSA-encrypted nonces. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain the encrypted nonces. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve77140.

System command injection in appGet.cgi on ASUS RT-AC3200 version 3.0.0.4.382.50010 allows attackers to execute system commands via the "load_script" URL parameter.
A vulnerability in the Smart Install feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition, or to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of packet data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Smart Install message to an affected device on TCP port 4786. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow on the affected device, which could have the following impacts: Triggering a reload of the device, Allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device, Causing an indefinite loop on the affected device that triggers a watchdog crash. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg76186.
A vulnerability in the implementation of the cluster feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation when handling Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious CMP message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the switch to crash and reload or to hang, resulting in a DoS condition. If the switch hangs it will not reboot automatically, and it will need to be power cycled manually to recover.

A vulnerability in the IP next-hop index database in Junos OS 17.3R3 may allow a flood of ARP requests, sent to the management interface, to exhaust the private Internal routing interfaces (IRIs) next-hop limit. Once the IRI next-hop database is full, no further next hops can be learned and existing entries cannot be cleared, leading to a sustained denial of service (DoS) condition. An indicator of compromise for this issue is the report of the following error message: %KERN-4: Nexthop index allocation failed: private index space exhausted This issue only affects the management interface, and does not impact regular transit traffic through the FPCs. This issue also only affects Junos OS 17.3R3. No prior versions of Junos OS are affected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 17.3R3.
An unauthenticated network-based attacker able to send a maliciously crafted LLDP packet to the local segment, through a local segment broadcast, may be able to cause a Junos device to enter an improper boundary check condition allowing a memory corruption to occur, leading to a denial of service. Further crafted packets may be able to sustain the denial of service condition. Score: 6.5 MEDIUM (CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) Further, if the attacker is authenticated on the target device receiving and processing the malicious LLDP packet, while receiving the crafted packets, the attacker may be able to perform command or arbitrary code injection over the target device thereby elevating their permissions and privileges, and taking control of the device. Score: 7.8 HIGH (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) An unauthenticated network-based attacker able to send a maliciously crafted LLDP packet to one or more local segments, via LLDP proxy / tunneling agents or other LLDP through Layer 3 deployments, through one or more local segment broadcasts, may be able to cause multiple Junos devices to enter an improper boundary check condition allowing a memory corruption to occur, leading to multiple distributed Denials of Services. These Denials of Services attacks may have cascading Denials of Services to adjacent connected devices, impacts network devices, servers, workstations, etc. Further crafted packets may be able to sustain these Denials of Services conditions. Score 6.8 MEDIUM (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H) Further, if the attacker is authenticated on one or more target devices receiving and processing these malicious LLDP packets, while receiving the crafted packets, the attacker may be able to perform command or arbitrary code injection over multiple target devices thereby elevating their permissions and privileges, and taking control multiple devices. Score: 7.8 HIGH (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.1X46 versions prior to 12.1X46-D71; 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S7; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D55; 14.1 versions prior to 14.1R8-S5, 14.1R9; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D46, 14.1X53-D50, 14.1X53-D107; 14.2 versions prior to 14.2R7-S9, 14.2R8; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1F2-S17, 15.1F5-S8, 15.1F6-S8, 15.1R5-S7, 15.1R7; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D90; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D65; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R4-S6, 16.1R5; 16.1X65 versions prior to 16.1X65-D45; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2.

The winbox service in MikroTik RouterOS 5.15 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption), read the router version, and possibly have other impacts via a request to download the router's DLLs or plugins, as demonstrated by roteros.dll.
By flooding a Juniper Networks router running Junos OS with specially crafted IPv6 traffic, all available resources can be consumed, leading to the inability to store next hop information for legitimate traffic. In extreme cases, the crafted IPv6 traffic may result in a total resource exhaustion and kernel panic. The issue is triggered by traffic destined to the router. Transit traffic does not trigger the vulnerability. This issue only affects devices with IPv6 enabled and configured. Devices not configured to process IPv6 traffic are unaffected by this vulnerability. This issue was found during internal product security testing. Juniper SIRT is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this vulnerability. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 11.4 prior to 11.4R13-S3; 12.3 prior to 12.3R3-S4; 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D30; 13.3 prior to 13.3R10, 13.3R4-S11; 14.1 prior to 14.1R2-S8, 14.1R4-S12, 14.1R8; 14.1X53 prior to 14.1X53-D28, 14.1X53-D40; 14.1X55 prior to 14.1X55-D35; 14.2 prior to 14.2R3-S10, 14.2R4-S7, 14.2R6; 15.1 prior to 15.1F2-S5, 15.1F5-S2, 15.1F6, 15.1R3; 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D40; 15.1X53 prior to 15.1X53-D57, 15.1X53-D70.
A vulnerability in the TACACS+ client subsystem of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of crafted TACACS+ response packets by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting a crafted TACACS+ packet into an existing TACACS+ session between an affected device and a TACACS+ server or by impersonating a known, valid TACACS+ server and sending a crafted TACACS+ packet to an affected device when establishing a connection to the device. To exploit this vulnerability by using either method, the attacker must know the shared TACACS+ secret and the crafted packet must be sent in response to a TACACS+ request from a TACACS+ client. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.
A vulnerability in the Network Address Translation 64 (NAT64) functions of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause either an interface queue wedge or a device reload. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of certain IPv4 packet streams that are sent through the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IPv4 packet streams through the device. An exploit could allow the attacker to either cause an interface queue wedge or a device reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
On Junos devices with the BGP graceful restart helper mode enabled or the BGP graceful restart mechanism enabled, a BGP session restart on a remote peer that has the graceful restart mechanism enabled may cause the local routing protocol daemon (RPD) process to crash and restart. By simulating a specific BGP session restart, an attacker can repeatedly crash the RPD process causing prolonged denial of service (DoS). Graceful restart helper mode for BGP is enabled by default. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7; 16.1X65 versions prior to 16.1X65-D48; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S8; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S7, 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S7, 17.2R3; 17.2X75 versions prior to 17.2X75-D92, 17.2X75-D102, 17.2X75-D110; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R2-S2, 17.3R3; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R1-S4, 17.4R2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2. Junos OS releases prior to 16.1R1 are not affected.
An issue was discovered on D-Link DIR-816 A2 1.10 B05 devices. An HTTP request parameter is used in command string construction within the handler function of the /goform/sylogapply route. This could lead to command injection via the syslogIp parameter after /goform/clearlog is invoked.
Receipt of a specific Draft-Rosen MVPN control packet may cause the routing protocol daemon (RPD) process to crash and restart or may lead to remote code execution. By continuously sending the same specific Draft-Rosen MVPN control packet, an attacker can repeatedly crash the RPD process causing a prolonged denial of service. This issue may occur when the Junos OS device is configured for Draft-Rosen multicast virtual private network (MVPN). The VPN is multicast-enabled and configured to use Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) protocol within the VPN. This issue can only be exploited from the PE device within the MPLS domain which is capable of forwarding IP multicast traffic in core. End-users connected to the CE device cannot cause this crash.

A vulnerability in telnetd service on Junos OS allows a remote attacker to cause a limited memory and/or CPU consumption denial of service attack. This issue was found during internal product security testing. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.1X46 prior to 12.1X46-D45; 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D30; 14.1 prior to 14.1R4-S9, 14.1R8; 14.2 prior to 14.2R6; 15.1 prior to 15.1F5, 15.1R3; 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D40; 15.1X53 prior to 15.1X53-D232, 15.1X53-D47.
The D-Link NPAPI extension, as used on D-Link DIR-850L REV. A (with firmware through FW114WWb07_h2ab_beta1) and REV. B (with firmware through FW208WWb02) devices, participates in mydlink Cloud Services by establishing a TCP relay service for HTTP, even though a TCP relay service for HTTPS is also established.
Cisco IOS 11.x and 12.0 through 12.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic block) by sending a particular sequence of IPv4 packets to an interface on the device, causing the input queue on that interface to be marked as full.
The cat6000-dot1x component in Cisco IOS 12.2 before 12.2(33)SXI7 does not properly handle (1) a loop between a dot1x enabled port and an open-authentication dot1x enabled port and (2) a loop between a dot1x enabled port and a non-dot1x port, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic storm) via unspecified vectors that trigger many Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) frames, aka Bug ID CSCtq36327.
The DHCP client on D-Link DIR-850L REV. A (with firmware through FW114WWb07_h2ab_beta1) and REV. B (with firmware through FW208WWb02) devices allows unauthenticated remote code execution as root because /etc/services/INET/inet_ipv4.php mishandles shell metacharacters, affecting generated files such as WAN-1-udhcpc.sh.
The routing protocol daemon (RPD) process will crash and restart when a specific invalid IPv4 PIM Join packet is received. While RPD restarts after a crash, repeated crashes can result in an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue only affects IPv4 PIM. IPv6 PIM is unaffected by this vulnerability. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.1X46 versions prior to 12.1X46-D77; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D77; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1F6-S10, 15.1R6-S6, 15.1R7; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D150; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D233, 15.1X53-D59; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R3-S8, 16.1R4-S8, 16.1R7; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S6; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S6, 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R2-S3, 17.2R3; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R2-S4, 17.3R3; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2.
QFX5200 and QFX10002 devices that have been shipped with Junos OS 15.1X53-D21, 15.1X53-D30, 15.1X53-D31, 15.1X53-D32, 15.1X53-D33 and 15.1X53-D60 or have been upgraded to these releases using the .bin or .iso images may contain an unintended additional Open Network Install Environment (ONIE) partition. This additional partition allows the superuser to reboot to the ONIE partition which will wipe out the content of the Junos partition and its configuration. Once rebooted, the ONIE partition will not have root password configured, thus any user can access the console or SSH, using an IP address acquired from DHCP, as root without password. Once the device has been shipped or upgraded with the ONIE partition installed, the issue will persist. Simply upgrading to higher release via the CLI will not resolve the issue. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.
Multiple SSH2 servers and clients do not properly handle packets or data elements with incorrect length specifiers, which may allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code, as demonstrated by the SSHredder SSH protocol test suite.
A vulnerability in the Cisco Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) processing code in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device or remotely execute code with elevated privileges. The Cluster Management Protocol utilizes Telnet internally as a signaling and command protocol between cluster members. The vulnerability is due to the combination of two factors: (1) the failure to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to internal, local communications between cluster members and instead accept and process such options over any Telnet connection to an affected device; and (2) the incorrect processing of malformed CMP-specific Telnet options.

Multiple buffer overflows in multiple unspecified implementations of Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) have multiple unspecified attack vectors and impacts related to denial of service, as demonstrated by the PROTOS ISAKMP Test Suite for IKEv1.  NOTE: due to the lack of information in the original sources, it is likely that this candidate will be REJECTed once it is known which implementations are actually vulnerable.
A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) module of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak or a reload of an affected device that leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain IKEv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKEv2 packets to an affected device to be processed. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to continuously consume memory and eventually reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf22394.
D-Link DIR-816 A2 1.10 B05 devices allow arbitrary remote code execution without authentication via the newpass parameter. In the /goform/form2userconfig.cgi handler function, a long password may lead to a stack-based buffer overflow and overwrite a return address.
Specific IPv6 DHCP packets received by the jdhcpd daemon will cause a memory resource consumption issue to occur on a Junos OS device using the jdhcpd daemon configured to respond to IPv6 requests. Once started, memory consumption will eventually impact any IPv4 or IPv6 request serviced by the jdhcpd daemon, thus creating a Denial of Service (DoS) condition to clients requesting and not receiving IP addresses. Additionally, some clients which were previously holding IPv6 addresses will not have their IPv6 Identity Association (IA) address and network tables agreed upon by the jdhcpd daemon after the failover event occurs, which leads to more than one interface, and multiple IP addresses, being denied on the client. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2.

The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS 12.0 through 12.4 and 15.0 through 15.6 and IOS XE 2.2 through 3.17 contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to remotely execute code on an affected system or cause an affected system to reload. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected system via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to an affected system can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are due to a buffer overflow condition in the SNMP subsystem of the affected software. The vulnerabilities affect all versions of SNMP: Versions 1, 2c, and 3. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system. All devices that have enabled SNMP and have not explicitly excluded the affected MIBs or OIDs should be considered vulnerable. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve66601.
A vulnerability in the SM-1T3/E3 firmware on Cisco Second Generation Integrated Services Routers (ISR G2) and the Cisco 4451-X Integrated Services Router (ISR4451-X) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the ISR G2 Router or the SM-1T3/E3 module on the ISR4451-X to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by first connecting to the SM-1T3/E3 module console and entering a string sequence. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ISR G2 Router or the SM-1T3/E3 module on the ISR4451-X to reload, resulting in a DoS condition on an affected device.
Secure Shell (SSH) 2 in Cisco IOS 12.0 through 12.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device reload) (1) via a username that contains a domain name when using a TACACS+ server to authenticate, (2) when a new SSH session is in the login phase and a currently logged in user issues a send command, or (3) when IOS is logging messages and an SSH session is terminated while the server is sending data.
An issue was discovered on D-Link DIR-816 A2 1.10 B05 devices. An HTTP request parameter is used in command string construction in the handler function of the /goform/Diagnosis route. This could lead to command injection via shell metacharacters in the sendNum parameter.
A vulnerability in the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) offload implementation of Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series Switches and Cisco Catalyst 4500-X Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a crash of the iosd process, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling when the BFD header in a BFD packet is incomplete. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BFD message to or across an affected switch. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of the system. This vulnerability affects Catalyst 4500 Supervisor Engine 6-E (K5), Catalyst 4500 Supervisor Engine 6L-E (K10), Catalyst 4500 Supervisor Engine 7-E (K10), Catalyst 4500 Supervisor Engine 7L-E (K10), Catalyst 4500E Supervisor Engine 8-E (K10), Catalyst 4500E Supervisor Engine 8L-E (K10), Catalyst 4500E Supervisor Engine 9-E (K10), Catalyst 4500-X Series Switches (K10), Catalyst 4900M Switch (K5), Catalyst 4948E Ethernet Switch (K5).

A vulnerability in the DHCP option 82 encapsulation functionality of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists because the affected software performs incomplete input validation of option 82 information that it receives in DHCP Version 4 (DHCPv4) packets from DHCP relay agents. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCPv4 packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuh91645.
A high rate of VLAN authentication attempts sent from an adjacent host on the local broadcast domain can trigger high memory utilization by the BBE subscriber management daemon (bbe-smgd), and lead to a denial of service condition. The issue was caused by attempting to process an unbounded number of pending VLAN authentication requests, leading to excessive memory allocation. This issue only affects devices configured for DHCPv4/v6 over AE auto-sensed VLANs, utilized in Broadband Edge (BBE) deployments. Other configurations are unaffected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R6-S2, 15.1R7; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R5-S1, 16.1R6; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S2, 16.2R3; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S5, 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R2.

When "set system ports console insecure" is enabled, root login is disallowed for Junos OS as expected. However, the root password can be changed using "set system root-authentication plain-text-password" on systems booted from an OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) volume, leading to a possible administrative bypass with physical access to the console. OAM volumes (e.g. flash drives) are typically instantiated as /dev/gpt/oam, or /oam for short. Password recovery, changing the root password from a console, should not have been allowed from an insecure console. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1F6-S12, 15.1R7-S3; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D160; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D236, 15.1X53-D496, 15.1X53-D68; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R3-S10, 16.1R6-S6, 16.1R7-S3; 16.1X65 versions prior to 16.1X65-D49; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S8; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S10, 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S8, 17.2R3-S1; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S3; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R1-S6, 17.4R2-S2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2-S4, 18.1R3-S3; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2; 18.2X75 versions prior to 18.2X75-D40; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R1-S2.

This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to take full control of the OSPF Autonomous System (AS) domain routing table, allowing the attacker to intercept or black-hole traffic. The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting crafted OSPF packets. Successful exploitation could cause the targeted router to flush its routing table and propagate the crafted OSPF LSA type 1 update throughout the OSPF AS domain. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must accurately determine certain parameters within the LSA database on the target router. This vulnerability can only be triggered by sending crafted unicast or multicast OSPF LSA type 1 packets. No other LSA type packets can trigger this vulnerability. OSPFv3 is not affected by this vulnerability. Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF) protocol is not affected by this vulnerability. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCva74756, CSCve47393, CSCve47401.

Receipt of specially crafted UDP/IP packets over MPLS may be able to bypass a stateless firewall filter. The crafted UDP packets must be encapsulated and meet a very specific packet format to be classified in a way that bypasses IP firewall filter rules. The packets themselves do not cause a service interruption (e.g. RPD crash), but receipt of a high rate of UDP packets may be able to contribute to a denial of service attack. This issue only affects processing of transit UDP/IP packets over MPLS, received on an interface with MPLS enabled. TCP packet processing and non-MPLS encapsulated UDP packet processing are unaffected by this issue.

The receipt of a crafted BGP UPDATE can lead to a routing process daemon (RPD) crash and restart. Repeated receipt of the same crafted BGP UPDATE can result in an extended denial of service condition for the device. This issue only affects the specific versions of Junos OS listed within this advisory. Earlier releases are unaffected by this vulnerability. This crafted BGP UPDATE does not propagate to other BGP peers. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 16.1X65 versions prior to 16.1X65-D47; 17.2X75 versions prior to 17.2X75-D91, 17.2X75-D110; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R1-S4, 17.3R2; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R1-S3, 17.4R2.
On EX4300 Series switches with TCAM optimization enabled, incoming multicast traffic matches an implicit loopback filter rule first, since it has high priority. This rule is meant for reserved multicast addresses 224.0.0.x, but incorrectly matches on 224.x.x.x. Due to this bug, when a firewall filter is applied on the loopback interface, other firewall filters might stop working for multicast traffic. The command 'show firewall filter' can be used to confirm whether the filter is working. This issue only affects the EX4300 switch. No other products or platforms are affected by this vulnerability. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D51, 14.1X53-D115 on EX4300 Series; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R3 on EX4300 Series; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R3-S2 on EX4300 Series; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S3 on EX4300 Series; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S5, 17.4R3 on EX4300 Series; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S1 on EX4300 Series; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2 on EX4300 Series; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2 on EX4300 Series.

A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) over an Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) for Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition, or potentially corrupt the BGP routing table, which could result in network instability. The vulnerability exists due to changes in the implementation of the BGP MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN RFC (RFC 7432) draft between IOS XE software releases. When the BGP Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag Route or BGP EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement Route update packet is received, it could be possible that the IP address length field is miscalculated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BGP packet to an affected device after the BGP session was established. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload or corrupt the BGP routing table; either outcome would result in a DoS. The vulnerability may be triggered when the router receives a crafted BGP message from a peer on an existing BGP session. This vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco IOS XE Software prior to software release 16.3 that support BGP EVPN configurations. If the device is not configured for EVPN, it is not vulnerable. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCui67191, CSCvg52875.

A vulnerability in the processing of IP Service Level Agreement (SLA) packets by Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an interface wedge and an eventual denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper socket resources handling in the IP SLA responder application code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IP SLA packets to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an interface to become wedged, resulting in an eventual denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.
The Integrated User Firewall (UserFW) feature was introduced in Junos OS version 12.1X47-D10 on the Juniper SRX Series devices to provide simple integration of user profiles on top of the existing firewall polices. As part of an internal security review of the UserFW services authentication API, hardcoded credentials were identified and removed which can impact both the SRX Series device, and potentially LDAP and Active Directory integrated points. An attacker may be able to completely compromise SRX Series devices, as well as Active Directory servers and services. When Active Directory is compromised, it may allow access to user credentials, workstations, servers performing other functions such as email, database, etc. Inter-Forest Active Directory deployments may also be at risk as the attacker may gain full administrative control over one or more Active Directories depending on the credentials supplied by the administrator of the AD domains and SRX devices performing integrated authentication of users, groups and devices. To identify if your device is potentially vulnerable to exploitation, check to see if the service is operating; from CLI review the following output: root@SRX-Firewall# run show services user-identification active-directory-access domain-controller status extensive A result of "Status: Connected" will indicate that the service is active on the device. To evaluate if user authentication is occurring through the device: root@SRX-Firewall# run show services user-identification active-directory-access active-directory-authentication-table all Next review the results to see if valid users and groups are returned. e.g. Domain: juniperlab.com Total entries: 3 Source IP Username groups state 172.16.26.1 administrator Valid 192.168.26.2 engg01 engineers Valid 192.168.26.3 guest01 guests Valid Domain: NULL Total entries: 8 Source IP Username groups state 192.168.26.4 Invalid 192.168.26.5 Invalid This will also indicate that Valid users and groups are authenticating through the device. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3X48 from 12.3X48-D30 and prior to 12.3X48-D35 on SRX series; 15.1X49 from 15.1X49-D40 and prior to 15.1X49-D50 on SRX series. Devices on any version of Junos OS 12.1X46, or 12.1X47 are unaffected by this issue.
